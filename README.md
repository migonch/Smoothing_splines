# smoothing_splines
This is my small project on the Advanced Statistical Methods course

The notebook contains some toy experiments that show how do smoothing splines work and also how one can perform data-driven adjusting of the smoothing parameter (or other hyperparameters) using a statistical "trick" which is known as SURE (Stein's unbiased risk estimation).
